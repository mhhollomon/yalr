## On Master

## Release v0.0.1

First Release. Core Lexer and Parser are functional. The parser is only SLR(1)
at this point. It will be upgraded to LALR(1) in the future.

Currently the generated paraser only operates as a recognizer. There is no way
to compute or store semantic values or attributes.
